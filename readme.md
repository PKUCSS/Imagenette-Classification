# Imagenette Classification

Here is a description of my implementation for Imagenette classification, as a practice project for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course in Peking University, spring 2021. I train a Resnet18 model which reaches 92.48% test accuracy as my baseline. Furthermore, I discuss the effect of several factors including the depth of the model, the choice of training batch size and the effect of weight decay by conducting ablation study experiments. For more details, please see the [report](./report.pdf).
